# Learn Go: My Project-Based Journey

[![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.2x-blue.svg)](https://golang.org/)

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey learning Go through practical projects and focused code examples. Each directory contains real code and mini-projects that helped me understand Go's core concepts.

## Repository Structure

```
├── Function/         
├── Conditonal/        
├── Loops/          
├── Strings/        
├── Slices/    
├── Maps/      
└── README.md       # This file
```

## How to Explore

- **Function/**: Foundational Go syntax, variables, and functions.
- **Conditonal/**: Control flow with if, for, switch, and error handling.
- **Loops/**: Working with arrays, slices, and maps.
- **Strings/**: Structs, methods, and interfaces in action.
- **Slices/**: Goroutines, channels, and synchronization patterns.
- **Maps/**: Small, self-contained Go projects and exercises.

## Getting Started
