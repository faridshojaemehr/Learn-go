This repository is a personal collection of Go code, examples, and small projects created as part of my journey to learn the Go programming language. It's structured to follow a logical progression from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Go installed on your system.

- **Install Go:** [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories, each focusing on a specific area of Go:

```
/Users/faridshojaemehr/Develop/Go/
├── basics/         # Go syntax, variables, types, functions
├── control/        # Conditionals, loops, switch statements
├── collections/    # Arrays, slices, maps
├── structs/        # Structs, methods, interfaces
├── concurrency/    # Goroutines, channels, sync
├── projects/       # Mini-projects and exercises
└── README.md       # This file
```

## How to Use

1. **Start with `basics/`**  
    Learn Go fundamentals: syntax, variables, types, and functions.

2. **Move to `control/`**  
    Practice control flow: if, for, switch, and error handling.

3. **Explore `collections/`**  
    Work with arrays, slices, and maps.

4. **Understand `structs/`**  
    Dive into structs, methods, and interfaces.

5. **Learn `concurrency/`**  
    Experiment with goroutines, channels, and synchronization.

6. **Build in `projects/`**  
    Apply your knowledge with small projects and exercises.

## Getting Started

- Install Go: [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Run examples:  
  ```sh
  go run basics/hello.go
  ```
