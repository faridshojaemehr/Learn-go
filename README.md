# Learn Go: My Project-Based Journey

[![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.2x-blue.svg)](https://golang.org/)

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey learning Go through practical projects and focused code examples. Each directory contains real code and mini-projects that helped me understand Go's core concepts.

## Repository Structure

```
